This Hamster hotel is only programmed for responsiveness on desktop, laptop, and tablet. If you are on a phone, then well, too bad for you!

Good work! Overall, looks pretty good on my desktop and in the laptop mode while using the developer tools to test responsiveness. It didn't work so well the smaller it got, but overall good job! Clean code made it very easy to understand the thought process.
